Include Headers: The code includes necessary headers like <iostream>, <vector>, <omp.h>, and <climits>.

Namespace: The using namespace std; statement brings all the symbols in the standard C++ library into the current namespace for convenience.

Function Definitions:
min_reduction, max_reduction, sum_reduction, and average_reduction are functions to calculate the minimum, maximum, sum, and average of elements in a given vector, respectively. They use OpenMP reduction clauses to parallelize the operations.

Main Function:
The main function first prompts the user to input the number of elements (n) and then the elements themselves.
It then calls each of the four reduction functions (min_reduction, max_reduction, sum_reduction, and average_reduction) passing the vector of elements to each function.

Parallelization:
Inside each reduction function, OpenMP directives are used to parallelize the for loop that iterates over the elements of the vector.
The #pragma omp parallel for directive parallelizes the loop by distributing its iterations among multiple threads.
The reduction clause in each directive ensures that each thread has its own private copy of the specified variable(s) (min_value, max_value, sum), and at the end of the parallel region, these private copies are combined together according to the specified operation (min, max, +) to produce the final result.
This way, the minimum, maximum, sum, and average of the elements are computed in parallel by multiple threads, utilizing the available CPU cores efficiently.

Output:
After the parallel computation in each reduction function, the computed result is printed to the console.
So theoretically, the provided code parallelizes the computation of minimum, maximum, sum, and average of elements in a vector using OpenMP directives, allowing multiple threads to work on different portions of the vector simultaneously and combining the results at the end to obtain the final output.
