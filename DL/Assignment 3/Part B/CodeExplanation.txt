import numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library with the alias np, which is used for numerical computations.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Imports the Matplotlib library with the alias plt, which is used for data visualization.
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist: Imports the Fashion MNIST dataset from TensorFlow's Keras API.
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential: Imports the Sequential class from Keras, which is used to create a sequential neural network model.
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense: Imports various layer types from Keras, including convolutional, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical: Imports the to_categorical function from Keras utils, which is used to convert class vectors (integers) to binary class matrices for categorical classification.
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data(): Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset into training and testing sets, including images and their corresponding labels.
train_images = ...: Preprocesses the training images by reshaping them to have a single channel (grayscale), normalizing the pixel values to the range [0, 1], and converting the data type to float32.
test_images = ...: Preprocesses the testing images in the same way as the training images.
train_labels = ...: Converts the training labels to categorical format using to_categorical.
test_labels = ...: Converts the testing labels to categorical format using to_categorical.
model = Sequential([...]): Defines a sequential model using Keras' Sequential API, comprising convolutional, max pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
model.compile(...): Compiles the model, specifying the optimizer (Adam), loss function (categorical crossentropy), and evaluation metric (accuracy).
model.fit(...): Trains the model on the training data for 15 epochs with a batch size of 64 and a validation split of 0.2.
random_indices = ...: Selects random indices from the test set to pick sample images for visualization.
sample_images = ...: Selects sample images from the test set based on the randomly chosen indices.
sample_labels = ...: Selects corresponding sample labels from the test set.
predictions = ...: Makes predictions on the sample images using the trained model.
predicted_labels = ...: Converts the predicted probabilities to class labels.
class_labels = [...]: Defines class labels for visualization.
plt.figure(...): Sets up the Matplotlib figure for displaying images with true and predicted labels.
for i in range(num_samples):: Iterates over each sample image to display it with its true and predicted labels.
plt.subplot(...): Creates subplots within the figure to display each image.
plt.imshow(...): Displays the image using Matplotlib's imshow function.
plt.title(...): Sets the title of each subplot with the true and predicted labels.
plt.axis('off'): Turns off the axis labels for cleaner visualization.
plt.tight_layout(): Adjusts the layout of subplots to prevent overlapping.
plt.show(): Displays the Matplotlib figure containing the sample images with their true and predicted labels.
